# Scilab Based Simulations in Mathematical Physics

## Overview

This repository contains various simulations and experiments conducted using Scilab to solve problems in mathematical physics.

## Projects

1. **Differential Equations**
   - Solved differential equations like \( \frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-x} \) and higher-order equations.

2. **Dirac Delta Function**
   - Evaluated \( \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{(x-2)^2}{2\sigma^2}} (x + 3) dx \) for \( \sigma = 1, 0.1, 0.01 \).

3. **Fourier Series**
   - Summed series and evaluated Fourier coefficients for periodic functions such as square waves.

4. **Frobenius Method and Special Functions**
   - Implemented Frobenius method, plotted special functions like Legendre and Bessel functions, and showed recursion relations.

5. **Trigonometric and Complex Functions**
   - Evaluated trigonometric functions (e.g., sin Î¸), and integrated complex functions numerically.

6. **Error Calculation**
   - Calculated errors for data points from previous experiments.

7. **Least Square Fitting**
   - Performed manual least square fitting and confirmed results through computer programs.

8. **Fast Fourier Transform**
   - Applied Fast Fourier Transform to \( e^{-x^2} \).
